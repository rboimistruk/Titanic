```

```{r data, warning=FALSE}
full <- read.csv("titanic/train.csv", stringsAsFactors = T) #1:891 - fulling set
test <- read.csv("titanic/test.csv", stringsAsFactors = T) #892:1309 - test set
full <- bind_rows(full, test)
```

##2. Data Overview

```{r giveninfo, echo = F}
kable(data.frame(Variable = c("PassengerId", "Survived", "Pclass", "Name", "Sex", "Age", "SibSp", "Parch", "Ticket", "Fare", "Cabin", "Embarked"),
           Definition = c("PassengerId", "Survival", "Ticket Class", "Name", "Sex", "Age", "# of siblings / spouses aboard", "# of parents / children aboard", 
                          "Ticket number", "Passenger fare", "Cabin number", "Port of Embarkation"),
           Key = c("", "1 = Yes, 0 = No", "1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, <br>3 = 3rd", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "C = Cherbourg, <br>Q = Queenstown, <br>S = Southampton"),
           Notes = c("", "", "A proxy for socio-economic status (SES) <br>1st = Upper, 2nd = Middle, 3rd = Lower", "", "", 
                     "Age is fractional if less than 1. <br>If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5", 
                     "Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister, <br>Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored)",
                     "Parent = mother, father, <br>Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson, <br>Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them",
                     "", "", "", "")))
```

##3. Summary of the data

```{r summary}
str(full)
summary(full)
```

```{r}
head(full)
tail(full)
```

##4. Removing/replacing NAs

Alright, we got an idea about our fulling dataset.
We can see from summary analysis that we hava some NAs (or missing values). Let's check again with NAs plot using *missmap function*:

```{r NA plot, fig.width=7, fig.height=3}
missmap(full, col = c("white","darkblue"), legend = F,  main = "Missing Values")
```

So, only Age varibale has some NAs which we should either ignore or replace with the actual values. Embarked and Cabin variables have also some empty values.

Let's start with the simple stuff and replace Embarked empty values with "S" - the most popular value and replacing missing Fare value with the average

```{r}
full$Embarked[full$Embarked == ""] <- "S"
full$Fare[is.na(full$Fare)] <- round(mean(full$Fare, na.rm = T),0)
full$Pclass <- as.factor(full$Pclass)
full$Survived <- as.factor(full$Survived)
full$Embarked <- as.factor(full$Embarked)
```

To fill Age NAs I'm gonna use random forest to predict the Age based on other characteristics
```{r}
full$Age.old <- full$Age
fit <- train(Age~Pclass + Sex + Embarked + SibSp + Parch + Fare, data = full[!is.na(full$Age),], method="rf", trControl=trainControl(method="cv", number=10))
new <- cbind(full[is.na(full$Age),], predict(fit, full[is.na(full$Age),]))
full$Age[is.na(full$Age)] <- new[,14]
full$Age <- as.numeric(full$Age)
```
```{r}
summary(full$Age)
summary(full$Embarked)
```

###5. Data Visualization

Now, let's visualise all variables and highlight Survivals vs. Non-Survivals among each of the characteristics to see the correlation.

##5.1. Ticket Class

All passengers were divided into 3 different classes - 1st, 2nd and 3d. The graph shows that people from the first class were more likely to survive and passengers from the thirs had the lowest chance.

```{r fig.height=4}
ggplot(data = full[!is.na(full$Survived),], aes(as.factor(Pclass), fill = as.factor(Survived))) +
     geom_bar(position = 'fill') +
     labs(x = "Ticket Class") +
     ggtitle("Survivals by the Ticket Class") +
     scale_fill_discrete(name = "Survived",
                         breaks = c(0,1),
                         labels = c("No", "Yes")) +
     theme(legend.position="top", plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

##5.2. Sex

Even stronger relationships are between gender and survival rate. Women were much more more likely to survive than

```{r fig.height=4}
ggplot(data = full[!is.na(full$Survived),], aes(Sex, fill = as.factor(Survived))) +
     geom_bar(position = 'fill') +
     labs(x = "Sex") +
     ggtitle("Survivals by the sex") +
     scale_fill_discrete(name = "Survived",
                         breaks = c(0,1),
                         labels = c("No", "Yes")) +
     theme(legend.position="top", plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

##5.3. Siblings, spouses, parents and children

Now we are looking at the number pf family members of each passanger and how this may have affected the survival rate.
We can see that the majority of people had 0 or 1 siblings or spouses and 0,1 or 2 parents/kids. The sample size of other variables is very small to take it into consideration. 

One interesting feature here is that people who had at least one family member had better chance. We can use this further in feature engineering to create a new variable identifing people with 1+ family member. 

```{r fig.width=10, fig.height=5}
p1 <- ggplot(data = full[!is.na(full$Survived),], aes(as.factor(SibSp), fill = as.factor(Survived))) +
     geom_bar(position = 'fill') +
     labs(x = "Number of Siblings") +
     ggtitle("Survivals by the number of siblings/spouses") +
     scale_fill_discrete(name = "Survived",
                         breaks = c(0,1),
                         labels = c("No", "Yes")) +
     theme(legend.position="top", plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

p2 <- ggplot(data = full[!is.na(full$Survived),], aes(as.factor(Parch), fill = as.factor(Survived))) +
     geom_bar(position = 'fill') +
     labs(x = "Number of Parents/Children") +
     ggtitle("Survivals by the number of Parents/Children") +
     scale_fill_discrete(name = "Survived",
                         breaks = c(0,1),
                         labels = c("No", "Yes")) +
     theme(legend.position="top", plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

p3 <- ggplot(data = full[!is.na(full$Survived),], aes(as.factor(SibSp), fill = as.factor(Survived))) +
     geom_bar() +
     labs(x = "Number of Siblings") +
     ggtitle("Survivals by the number of siblings/spouses") +
     scale_fill_discrete(name = "Survived",
                         breaks = c(0,1),
                         labels = c("No", "Yes")) +
     theme(legend.position="top", plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

p4 <- ggplot(data = full[!is.na(full$Survived),], aes(as.factor(Parch), fill = as.factor(Survived))) +
     geom_bar() +
     labs(x = "Number of Parents/Children") +
     ggtitle("Survivals by the number of Parents/Children") +
     scale_fill_discrete(name = "Survived",
                         breaks = c(0,1),
                         labels = c("No", "Yes")) +
     theme(legend.position="top", plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
grid.arrange(p1,p2,p3,p4, nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
```

##5.4. Age

Below is the histogram of the Age variable with 2 density lines (Red is for non-survivavls and the green one is fro survivals).
Interesting to notice that the dendsity line of survivals is slightly skewed to the left compared to the red line, which means that yonger passangers were more likely to survive (which actually works well with our statement that women had also better chance - *women and kids were to be saved first*)  


```{r fig.height=4}
ggplot(data = full[!is.na(full$Survived),], aes(x = Age, fill = as.factor(Survived))) +
     geom_histogram(bins = 15, aes(y = ..density..)) +
     labs(x = "Number of Siblings") +
     ggtitle("Survivals by age") +
     scale_fill_discrete(name = "Survived",
                         breaks = c(0,1),
                         labels = c("No", "Yes")) +
     theme(legend.position="top", plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
     stat_function(fun = dnorm, 
                args = list(mean = mean(full$Age[full$Survived == "0"]), sd = sd(full$Age[full$Survived == "0"])), 
                lwd = 1, 
                col = 'red') + 
     stat_function(fun = dnorm, 
                args = list(mean = mean(full$Age[full$Survived == "1"]), sd = sd(full$Age[full$Survived == "1"])), 
                lwd = 1, 
                col = 'darkgreen')
```

##5.5. Embarked

And lastly I'm gonna plot survivals by the port of embarkation. We can see that the port of embarkation have slight impact ofthe survival rate (passengers who embarked in Cherbourg have slightly higher survival rate compared to those who embarked in Southhampton). 
This also could be explain, for example, that many women embarked in Cherbourg or people from the first class etc. So we should explore this more, but I will leave this by now.

```{r fig.width=9, fig.height=4}
p5 <- ggplot(data = full[!is.na(full$Survived),], aes(Embarked, fill = as.factor(Survived))) +
     geom_bar(position = 'fill') +
     labs(x = "Port of Embarkation") +
     ggtitle("Survivals by port of Embarkation") +
     scale_fill_discrete(name = "Survived",
                         breaks = c(0,1),
                         labels = c("No", "Yes")) +
     theme(legend.position="top", plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

p6 <- ggplot(data = full[!is.na(full$Survived),], aes(Embarked, fill = as.factor(Survived))) +
     geom_bar() +
     labs(x = "Port of Embarkation") +
     ggtitle("Survivals by port of Embarkation") +
     scale_fill_discrete(name = "Survived",
                         breaks = c(0,1),
                         labels = c("No", "Yes")) +
     theme(legend.position="top", plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

grid.arrange(p5,p6, ncol = 2)
```

So we looked at all variables and got an idea of the data distribution and the impact of some of the variables on the survivals rate.
Next step is feature engineering!

##5. Feature Engineering

Let's see what else can we get from the data.

###5.1 Titles

```{r}
head(full$Name, n = 10)
```

We can see the pattern that each name includes the passanger title (Mr., Mrs., Master etc.). Let's extract this infrmation and create a new variable **Title**:


```{r}
full$Title[grepl("Mr\\.", full$Name, ignore.case = T)] <- "Mr"
full$Title[grepl("Miss\\.|Mlle\\.|Ms\\.|Mme\\.", full$Name, ignore.case = T)] <- "Miss" 
full$Title[grepl("Mrs\\.", full$Name, ignore.case = T)] <- "Mrs"   
full$Title[grepl("Master\\.", full$Name, ignore.case = T)] <- "Master"  
full$Title[grepl("Don\\.", full$Name, ignore.case = T)] <- "Rare"
full$Title[grepl("Rev\\.", full$Name, ignore.case = T)] <- "Rare"
full$Title[grepl("Dr\\.", full$Name, ignore.case = T)] <- "Rare"
full$Title[grepl("Capt\\.", full$Name, ignore.case = T)] <- "Rare"
full$Title[grepl("Col\\.", full$Name, ignore.case = T)] <- "Rare"
full$Title[grepl("Sir\\.", full$Name, ignore.case = T)] <- "Rare"
full$Title[grepl("Major\\.", full$Name, ignore.case = T)] <- "Rare"
full$Title[grepl("Jonkheer\\.", full$Name, ignore.case = T)] <- "Rare"
full$Title[grepl("Countess\\.", full$Name, ignore.case = T)] <- "Rare"
full$Title[grepl("Lady\\.", full$Name, ignore.case = T)] <- "Rare"
full$Title[grepl("Dona\\.", full$Name, ignore.case = T)] <- "Rare"
full$Title <- as.factor(full$Title)
```

Alright! So we grouped up all the titles into categories [I also grouped all rare titles in Rare group]. Lets look at our result:

```{r}
summary(full$Title)
```

and let's visualize it:

```{r }
ggplot(data = full[!is.na(full$Survived),], aes(as.factor(Title), fill = as.factor(Survived))) +
     geom_bar(position = 'fill') +
     labs(x = "Title") +
     ggtitle("Survivals by the Title") +
     scale_fill_discrete(name = "Survived",
                         breaks = c(0,1),
                         labels = c("No", "Yes")) +
     theme(legend.position="top", plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

```{r }
full %>% group_by(Title) %>% summarise(mean.age = mean(Age))

```

Interesting! Married women were more likely to survive, titles "miss" and "master" also had a good chance (this could be explaine that these titles were used for unmerried women and young boys and we know that youngr passengers had slightly better chance)

###5.2 Tickets

```{r}
head(full$Ticket)
```

Fro the structure of the ticket variable we can see that each ticket consist of some digits and, in some cases, some letters. Let's disregards all letters and group all tickets only based om the first digit:

```{r}
full$Ticket.n[grepl("^1", gsub("[^0-9\\|]", "", full$Ticket))] <- 1
full$Ticket.n[grepl("^2", gsub("[^0-9\\|]", "", full$Ticket))] <- 2
full$Ticket.n[grepl("^3", gsub("[^0-9\\|]", "", full$Ticket))] <- 3
full$Ticket.n[grepl("^4", gsub("[^0-9\\|]", "", full$Ticket))] <- 4
full$Ticket.n[grepl("^5", gsub("[^0-9\\|]", "", full$Ticket))] <- 5
full$Ticket.n[grepl("^6", gsub("[^0-9\\|]", "", full$Ticket))] <- 6
full$Ticket.n[grepl("^7", gsub("[^0-9\\|]", "", full$Ticket))] <- 7
full$Ticket.n[grepl("^8", gsub("[^0-9\\|]", "", full$Ticket))] <- 8
full$Ticket.n[grepl("^9", gsub("[^0-9\\|]", "", full$Ticket))] <- 9
full$Ticket.n[full$Ticket == "LINE"] <- "Line"
full$Ticket.n <- as.factor(full$Ticket.n)
```

```{r}
summary(full$Ticket.n)
```
```{r fig.width=15, fig.height=4}
p7 <- ggplot(data = full[!is.na(full$Survived),], aes(as.factor(Ticket.n), fill = as.factor(Survived))) +
     geom_bar(position = 'fill') +
     labs(x = "Ticket Number") +
     ggtitle("Survivals by the Ticket") +
     scale_fill_discrete(name = "Survived",
                         breaks = c(0,1),
                         labels = c("No", "Yes")) +
     theme(legend.position="top", plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

p8 <- ggplot(data = full[!is.na(full$Survived),], aes(as.factor(Ticket.n), fill = as.factor(Survived))) +
     geom_bar() +
     labs(x = "Ticket Number") +
     ggtitle("Survivals by the Ticket") +
     scale_fill_discrete(name = "Survived",
                         breaks = c(0,1),
                         labels = c("No", "Yes")) +
     theme(legend.position="top", plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

p9 <- ggplot(data = full[!is.na(full$Survived),], aes(as.factor(Ticket.n), fill = as.factor(Survived))) +
     geom_bar() +
     labs(x = "Ticket Number") +
     ggtitle("Survivals by the Ticket") +
     scale_fill_discrete(name = "Survived",
                         breaks = c(0,1),
                         labels = c("No", "Yes")) +
     theme(legend.position="top", plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
     facet_grid(.~Pclass)

grid.arrange(p7,p8,p9, ncol = 3)
```

One interesting feature that we've discovered here is that passengers with the tickets that start with 1 had better chance. If we looked at the last gprah it's clear that tickets that start with 1 were more popular among 1st class, 2 with 2nd class and 3 with 3d class. 
So this variable could be highly correlated with the Pclass variable.

###5.3 Age groups - Kids & Adults

We've already cleaned Age values so let's just group them up into categories:

```{r}
full$Age.n[full$Age < 5] <- "<5"
full$Age.n[full$Age < 10 & full$Age >= 5] <- "5-10"
full$Age.n[full$Age < 20 & full$Age >= 10] <- "10-20"
full$Age.n[full$Age < 25 & full$Age >= 20] <- "20-25"
full$Age.n[full$Age < 28 & full$Age >= 25] <- "25-27"
full$Age.n[full$Age < 30 & full$Age >= 28] <- "28-29"
full$Age.n[full$Age < 33 & full$Age >= 30] <- "30-31"
full$Age.n[full$Age < 35 & full$Age >= 33] <- "32-34"
full$Age.n[full$Age < 40 & full$Age >= 35] <- "35-40"
full$Age.n[full$Age < 50 & full$Age >= 40] <- "40-50"
full$Age.n[full$Age < 100 & full$Age >= 50] <- "50+"
full$Age.n <- as.factor(full$Age.n)
full$Age.n <- factor(full$Age.n, levels = c("<5", "5-10", "10-20", "20-25", "25-27", "28-29", "30-31", "32-34", "35-40", "40-50", "50+"))
```

```{r fig.width=9, fig.height=4}
p10 <- ggplot(data = full[!is.na(full$Survived),], aes(as.factor(Age.n), fill = as.factor(Survived))) +
     geom_bar(position = 'fill') +
     labs(x = "Age groups") +
     ggtitle("Survivals by the Age groups") +
     scale_fill_discrete(name = "Survived",
                         breaks = c(0,1),
                         labels = c("No", "Yes")) +
     theme(legend.position="top", plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

p11 <- ggplot(data = full[!is.na(full$Survived),], aes(as.factor(Age.n), fill = as.factor(Survived))) +
     geom_histogram(stat="count") +
     labs(x = "Age groups") +
     ggtitle("Survivals by the Age groups") +
     scale_fill_discrete(name = "Survived",
                         breaks = c(0,1),
                         labels = c("No", "Yes")) +
     theme(legend.position="top", plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))


grid.arrange(p10,p11, ncol = 2)
```

Using the same approach we can create a new column **Kid** for passengers who are yonger than 14. 


```{r}
full$Kid <- "Adult"
full$Kid[full$Age < 14] <- "Kid"
full$Kid <- as.factor(full$Kid)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = full[!is.na(full$Survived),], aes(Kid, fill = as.factor(Survived))) +
     geom_bar(position = 'fill') +
     labs(x = "Kid or Adult") +
     ggtitle("Survivals by Kid/Adult") +
     scale_fill_discrete(name = "Survived",
                         breaks = c(0,1),
                         labels = c("No", "Yes")) +
     theme(legend.position="top", plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

Great. Kids had better chance to survive

###5.4 Familty Size

Let's just combined siblings, parents, children and spouses together in the new variable **Family Size**
Besides this I also want to add another variable for people with at least 1 family mamber aboard.
```{r}
full$FamilySize <- full$SibSp + full$Parch
full$FamilySize <- as.factor(full$FamilySize)

full$Family <- ifelse(as.numeric(full$FamilySize) >= 2, "Yes","No") #Family = Yes if passenger has at least one family member aboard
full$Family <- as.factor(full$Family)
```

```{r fig.width=9, fig.height=4}
p12 <- ggplot(data = full[!is.na(full$Survived),], aes(FamilySize, fill = as.factor(Survived))) +
     geom_bar(position = 'fill') +
     labs(x = "Familty Size") +
     ggtitle("Survivals by Family Size") +
     scale_fill_discrete(name = "Survived",
                         breaks = c(0,1),
                         labels = c("No", "Yes")) +
     theme(legend.position="top", plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

p13 <- ggplot(data = full[!is.na(full$Survived),], aes(as.factor(Family), fill = as.factor(Survived))) +
     geom_bar(position = 'fill') +
     labs(x = "Family aboard") +
     ggtitle("Survivals by Family Aboard") +
     scale_fill_discrete(name = "Survived",
                         breaks = c(0,1),
                         labels = c("No", "Yes")) +
     theme(legend.position="top", plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))


grid.arrange(p12,p13, ncol = 2)
```

##6. Predictions

Creating validation data set 80/20 using *caret* package 

```{r}
train <- full[1:891,]
test <- full[892:1309,]
fullIndex <- createDataPartition(train$Survived, p=0.8, list=FALSE) #Split the data 20/80
data_train <- train[ fullIndex,]
data_val <- train[-fullIndex,]
```

Assigning Control and Metic characteristics. I will use 10-fold Cross Validation and we want our model to show us its Accuracy and Kappa rather than RMSE

```{r}
control <- trainControl(method="cv", number=10)
metric <- "Accuracy"
```

###6.1. Linear Discriminant Analysis
```{r}
set.seed(7)
fit.lda <- train(as.factor(Survived)~Pclass+Title+Age+Fare, data = data_train, method="lda", metric=metric, trControl=control)
fit.lda
```

###6.2. Classification and Regression Trees
```{r}
set.seed(7)
fit.cart <- train(as.factor(Survived)~Pclass+Title+Age+Fare, data = data_train, method="rpart", metric=metric, trControl=control)
fit.cart
```

###6.3. k-Nearest Neighbors
```{r}
set.seed(7)
fit.knn <- train(as.factor(Survived)~Pclass+Title+Age+Fare, data = data_train, method="knn", metric=metric, trControl=control)
fit.knn
```

###6.4. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
```{r}
set.seed(7)
fit.svm <- train(as.factor(Survived)~Pclass+Title+Age+Fare, data = data_train, method="svmRadial", metric=metric, trControl=control)
fit.svm
```

###6.5. Random Forest
```{r}
set.seed(7)
fit.rf <- train(as.factor(Survived)~Pclass+Title+Age+Fare, data = data_train, method="rf", metric=metric, trControl=control)
fit.rf
```

###6.6. Logistics Regression
```{r}
set.seed(7)
fit.glm <- train(as.factor(Survived)~Pclass+Title+Age+Fare, data = data_train, method="glm", metric=metric, trControl=control)
fit.glm
```

###6.7 Results
Let's look at the results of all our models and plot the graph with Accuracy/Kappa.

```{r}
results <- resamples(list(lda=fit.lda, cart=fit.cart, knn=fit.knn, svm=fit.svm, rf=fit.rf, glm = fit.glm))
summary(results)
dotplot(results)
```

###6.8 Random Forest from **randomForest package**
```{r}
set.seed(7)
fit.rf1 <- randomForest(as.factor(Survived)~Pclass+Title+Age+Fare+Sex+FamilySize+Ticket.n+Family, data = data_train, ntree = 50)
fit.rf1

(fit.rf1$confusion[1,1]+fit.rf1$confusion[2,2])/714 #Accuracy
```

Ploting confusion matrix on the Random Forest (from **Caret** package), SVM and CART models (best performed models)

```{r}
confusionMatrix(predict(fit.rf, data_val), data_val$Survived)
confusionMatrix(predict(fit.svm, data_val), data_val$Survived)
confusionMatrix(predict(fit.cart, data_val), data_val$Survived)
```

As we can see Random Forest has higher Accuracy (~84%)

Now I'm gonna use Random Forest model to fit on test data set to predict Survivals:

```{r}
fit.final <- randomForest(as.factor(Survived)~Pclass+Title+Age+Fare+Sex+FamilySize+Ticket.n+Family, data = train, ntree = 50)
predictions <- predict(fit.final, test)
x <- cbind(test$PassengerId, as.data.frame(predictions))
colnames(x) <- c("PassengerID", "Survived")
write.csv(x, "submission.csv", row.names = F)
```
